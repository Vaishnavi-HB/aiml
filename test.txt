ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the capability of computational systems to perform tasks typically associated with human intelligence, such as :
learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and decision-making.
 It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals.
 High-profile applications of AI include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search); 
 recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix); 
 virtual assistants (e.g., Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa);
 autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo);
 generative and creative tools (e.g., ChatGPT and AI art); 
 and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and Go).
 However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: "A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it's not labeled AI anymore."
 AI and machine learning technology is used in most of the essential applications of the 2020s, including: search engines (such as Google Search),
 targeting online advertisements, recommendation systems (offered by Netflix, YouTube or Amazon),
 driving internet traffic, targeted advertising (AdSense, Facebook), virtual assistants (such as Siri or Alexa),
 autonomous vehicles (including drones, ADAS and self-driving cars),
 automatic language translation (Microsoft Translator, Google Translate), 
 facial recognition (Apple's Face ID or Microsoft's DeepFace and Google's FaceNet
 ) and image labeling (used by Facebook, Apple's iPhoto and TikTok). The deployment of AI may be overseen by a Chief automation officer (CAO).
